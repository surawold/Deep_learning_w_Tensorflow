# Deep_learning_w_Tensorflow
Constructing, training and testing deep neural network in python using Tensorflow 

Inspired by 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' by Michael Nielsen. In chapter 6 of the book, construction of deep network layer by layer is demonstrated using Theano. In this project, a similar approach is followed to construct netwrok architectures but using Tensorflow instead. Although Keras (with Tensorflow backend) can be used to hide all the details and construct the netwroks more easily, I still prefere to build such codes for sanity check.
