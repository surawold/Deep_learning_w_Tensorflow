# Deep learning with Tensorflow
Constructing, training and testing deep neural networks in python using Tensorflow 

Inspired by 'Neural Networks and Deep Learning' by Michael Nielsen. In chapter 6 of the book, construction of deep network layer by layer is demonstrated using Theano. In this project, a similar approach is followed to construct netwrok architectures using Tensorflow.
